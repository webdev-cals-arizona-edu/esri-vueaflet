# Esri-Vueaflet #
This library (or set of components) uses [Vueaflet](https://github.com/webdev-cals-arizona-edu/vueaflet) as its primary dependency. Similar to how Vueaflet provides a "vuetified" approach to handling Leaflet objects, Esri-Vueaflet provides the same methodology for handling Esri-Leaflet objects. All objects are managed in a Vuex store, providing the developer easy access from anywhere in their Vue application.
